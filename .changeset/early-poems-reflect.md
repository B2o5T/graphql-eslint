'@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin': minor
---

The new version no longer crashes on VSCode-ESLint, when schema/siblings contain validation errors,
also, GraphQL-ESLint now has `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json` and extends `@typescript-eslint`
recommended config ðŸš€

P.S. GraphQL-ESLint now has its own website, all documentation moved here. Also, it contains a new
fancy playground page ðŸ’… for both schema/operations testing
