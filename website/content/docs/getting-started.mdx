# Getting Started

## Configuration

To get started, define an override in your ESLint config to apply this plugin to `.graphql` files.
Add the [rules](/rules) you want applied.

```js filename="eslint.config.js"
import graphqlPlugin from '@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin'

export default [
  // ... other config
  {
    files: ['**/*.graphql'],
    languageOptions: {
      parser: graphqlPlugin.parser
    },
    plugins: {
      '@graphql-eslint': graphqlPlugin
    },
    rules: {
      '@graphql-eslint/known-type-names': 'error'
    }
  }
]
```

If your GraphQL definitions are defined only in `.graphql` files, and you're only using rules that
apply to individual files, you should be good to go üëç. If you would like use a remote schema or use
rules that apply across the entire collection of definitions at once, see
[here](#extended-linting-rules-with-graphql-schema).
