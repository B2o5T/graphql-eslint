# 🚧 Getting Started

<WIP />

## Configuration

To get started, define an override in your ESLint config to apply this plugin to `.graphql` files.
Add the [rules](/rules) you want applied.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This step is necessary even if you are declaring operations and/or schema in code files.

```js filename="eslint.config.js"
import graphqlPlugin from '@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin'

export default [
  // ... other config
  {
    files: ['**/*.graphql'],
    languageOptions: {
      parser: graphqlPlugin.parser
    },
    plugins: {
      '@graphql-eslint': graphqlPlugin
    },
    rules: {
      '@graphql-eslint/known-type-names': 'error'
    }
  }
]
```

If your GraphQL definitions are defined only in `.graphql` files, and you're only using rules that
apply to individual files, you should be good to go 👍. If you would like use a remote schema or use
rules that apply across the entire collection of definitions at once, see
[here](#extended-linting-rules-with-graphql-schema).

### Apply Plugin to GraphQL Definitions Defined in Code Files

If you are defining GraphQL schema or GraphQL operations in code files, you'll want to define an
additional override to extend the functionality of this plugin to the schema and operations in those
files.

```diff filename="eslint.config.js"
import graphqlPlugin from '@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin';

export default [
+ {
+   files: ['**/*.js'],
+   processor: graphqlPlugin.processor
+ },
  {
    files: ['**/*.graphql'],
    languageOptions: {
      parser: graphqlPlugin.parser
    },
    plugins: {
      '@graphql-eslint': graphqlPlugin
    },
    rules: {
      '@graphql-eslint/known-type-names': 'error'
    }
  }
]
```

Under the hood, specifying the `@graphql-eslint/graphql` processor for code files will cause
`graphql-eslint/graphql` to extract the schema and operation definitions from these files into
virtual GraphQL documents with `.graphql` extensions. This will allow the overrides you've defined
for `.graphql` files, via `"files": ["*.graphql"]`, to get applied to the definitions defined in
your code files.

### Extended Linting Rules with GraphQL Schema

Some rules require an understanding of the entire schema at once. For example,
[no-unreachable-types](../rules/no-unreachable-types) checks that all types are reachable by
root-level fields.

To use these rules, you'll need to tell ESLint how to identify the entire set of schema definitions.

`graphql-eslint` integrates with [`graphql-config`](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/config)
automatically and will use it to load your schema!

Alternatively, you can define `languageOptions.parserOptions.graphQLConfig.schema`.

The parser allows you to specify a `.json` file / `.graphql` files(s) / url / raw string to locate
your schema (We are using `graphql-tools` to do that).

```diff filename="eslint.config.js"
import graphqlPlugin from '@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin'

export default [
  // ... other config
  {
    files: ['**/*.graphql'],
    languageOptions: {
      parser: graphqlPlugin.parser,
+     parserOptions: {
+       graphQLConfig: {
+         schema: './schema.graphql'
+       }
+     }
    },
    plugins: {
      '@graphql-eslint': graphqlPlugin
    },
    rules: {
      '@graphql-eslint/no-unreachable-types': 'error'
    }
  }
]
```

> Some rules require type information to operate, it's marked in the docs for each rule!

### Extended Linting Rules with Siblings Operations

While implementing this tool, we had to find solutions for a better integration of the GraphQL
ecosystem and ESLint core.

GraphQL's operations can be distributed across many files, while ESLint operates on one file at a
time. If you are using GraphQL fragments in separate files, some rules might yield incorrect
results, due the missing information.

To workaround that, we allow you to provide additional information on your GraphQL operations,
making it available for rules while doing the actual linting.

To provide that, we are using `graphql-tools` loaders to load your sibling operations and fragments,
just specify a glob expression(s) that points to your code/`.graphql` files:

```diff filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "files": ["*.graphql"],
  "parser": "@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin",
  "plugins": ["@graphql-eslint"],
  "rules": {
    "@graphql-eslint/unique-operation-name": "error"
  },
  "parserOptions": {
+   "operations": "./src/**/*.graphql",
    "schema": "./schema.graphql"
  }
}
```
