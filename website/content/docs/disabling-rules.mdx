# Disabling Rules

The `graphql-eslint` parser looks for GraphQL comments syntax (marked with `#`) and will send it to
ESLint as directives. That means, you can use ESLint directives syntax to hint ESLint, just like in
any other type of files.

To disable ESLint for a specific line, you can do:

```graphql
# eslint-disable-next-line
type Query {
  foo: String!
}
```

You can also specify specific rules to disable, apply it over the entire file,
`eslint-disable-next-line` or current `eslint-disable-line`.

You can find a list of
[ESLint directives here](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/rules#using-configuration-comments-1).
