> If you are in a project that develops the GraphQL schema, you'll need `schema` rules.

> If you are in a project that develops GraphQL operations (query/mutation/subscription), you'll
> need `operations` rules.

> If you are in a monorepo project, you probably need both sets of rules, see
> [example of configuration](examples/monorepo/eslint.config.js).

### Config Usage

For example, to enable the `schema-recommended` config, enable it in your `.eslintrc` file with the
`extends` option:

> All configs under the hood set `parser` as `@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin` and add
> `@graphql-eslint` to `plugins` array, so you don't need to specify them.

```diff filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["*.js"],
      "processor": "@graphql-eslint/graphql"
    },
    {
      "files": ["*.graphql"],
-     "parser": "@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin",
-     "plugins": ["@graphql-eslint"],
+     "extends": "plugin:@graphql-eslint/schema-recommended"
    }
  ]
}
```
