# Usage with `.vue` files

`graphql-eslint` can lint GraphQL documents inside Vue Single-File Components (.vue files). It does
this in two steps: (1) extract the GraphQL documents from the Vue (or js/ts) file, and (2) lint the
extracted GraphQL documents.

If you don't embed GraphQL documents in your Vue files, you can skip this page.

<Callout type="warning">
  Due to [a limitation in
  graphql-tag-pluck](https://github.com/dimaMachina/graphql-eslint/issues/2103), lint violations
  will show up at the top of the Vue document, on the first character, not inline.
</Callout>

## Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `eslint.config.js` file to setup `@graphql-eslint` plugin.
The intermediate graphql files always have the .graphql extension. Make sure the second block
matches those files, even if you use another extension for your project's GraphQL (e.g. .gql).

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure the first section, which extracts GrahpQL from Vue files, comes **before** any other Vue
  rules. Otherwise, eslint may incorrectly rewrite all error messages to say only "clear."
</Callout>

```js filename="eslint.config.js"
import graphqlPlugin from '@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin'

export default [
  {
    // NOTE: Order matters! This has to happen FIRST, before any block that
    // includes the Vue parser (including e.g. recommended Vue ESLint rules).
    // It also has to be before the .graphql block, below
    //
    // Extract GraphQL from files for linting -- this creates .graphql files
    // that are then linted below
    //
    // graphql-eslint scans all files (using the processor lsited) and outputs
    // an intermediate file with the extracted GraphQL. That intermediate file
    // is then linted, generating the errors we see. The intermediate file has
    // a fixed .graphql extension, so you need to include that extension below
    // or these files won't be linted.
    files: ['**/*.js', '**/*.ts', '**/*.vue'],
    processor: graphql.processors.graphql
    // NOTE: While you CAN put rules here to affect JS/TS/Vue files, those
    // rules won't affect GraphQL. To modify rules that effect GrahpQL inside
    // these files, add those to the block for .graphql files, below.
  },
  // ...other config
  {
    // Lint all GraphQL files, including the intermediate ones above. If you
    // want to tune the rules that appear in your files, even Vue/JS/TS files,
    // put those rule changes HERE
    files: ['**/*.graphql'], // Add .gql extension if you use that
    languageOptions: {
      parser: graphqlPlugin.parser
    },

    // Any rule overrides for GraphQL go HERE. For example, to enable
    // recommended operations rules
    plugins: { '@graphql-eslint': { rules: graphqlESLint.rules } },
    rules: {
      ...graphqlESLint.configs['flat/operations-recommended']
      // Can also override the recommended rules here, e.g.:
      // "@graphql-eslint/naming-convention": ["off"],
    }
  }
]
```
