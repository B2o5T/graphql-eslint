# {metadata.title}

Use
[ESLint VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
to integrate ESLint into VSCode.

For syntax highlighting you need a GraphQL extension (which may potentially have its own linting),
for example
[GraphQL (by GraphQL Foundation)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql).
